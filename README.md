# Nox Survival
 
This is a mini 3D RPG style game that allows the player to have HP/MP and other player attributes constisting of Strength, Dex, Intellegence, Vigor, etc
This project is developed at Marshall HS as a group project between 4 students; most of whom this is their first game dev project. So it might be very unpolished but itll be playable atleast
